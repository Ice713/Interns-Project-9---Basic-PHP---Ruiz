# Interns-Project-9---Basic-PHP---Ruiz

When trying to run this code, first, make it sure that your database is good.

For me, I used Laragon. 

First step is to follow along this tutorial from YouTube

And then, place the uploaded file in this repository to the folder, just like how it is done in the Youtube tutorial.

Thank you!
