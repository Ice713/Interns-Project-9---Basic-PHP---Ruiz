# Interns-Project-9---Basic-PHP---Ruiz

When trying to run this code, first, make it sure that your database is good.

For me, I used Laragon. 

First step is to follow along this tutorial from YouTube
https://youtu.be/TvX712tpXlc

And then, place the uploaded .php files from this repository to the PHP-CRUD folder you created on Laragon, just like how it is done in the Youtube tutorial.

For DATABASE FILES
Please strictly comply:

When using laragon, add the crud folder from this repository to this folder â†’ laragon\data\mysql

Or else, the database would appear empty, or worse, disconnected.

Also, please modify the line number 5 of process.php in accordance to the credentials of your database.

Thank you!
