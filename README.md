# Interns-Project-9---Basic-PHP---Ruiz

When trying to run this code, first, make it sure that your database is good.

For me, I used Laragon. 

First step is to follow along this tutorial from YouTube
https://youtu.be/TvX712tpXlc

And then, place the uploaded file in this repository to the folder, just like how it is done in the Youtube tutorial.

For DATABASE FILES
Please strictly comply:

When using laragon, add this file to this folder
laragon\data\mysql

Or else, the database would appear empty, or worse, disconnected.

Also, please modify the line number 5 of process.php in accordance to the credentials of your database.

Thank you!
